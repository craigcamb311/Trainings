What is Cloud?

US NIST definition 
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology IT that has five equally important traits 

01 - Customers get computing resources that are ondemand and self-service  
02 - Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere 
03 - The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool 
04 - Resources are elastic - which means they're flexible, so customers can be
05 - Customers pay only for what they use or reverse as they go. 

PaaS - Platform as a Service
- Compute
- Storage 
- Network capabilities 
- Pay for what they allocate


IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
- bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure
- Pay for what they use

Serverless technologies 
-  Cloud Functions, which manages event driven code as a pay as you go service
-  Cloud Run, which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices based application, in a fully managed environment

SaaS - Software as a Service
Software that runs in the cloud

Google cloud runs on googles own network.

five major geographic locations: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia
location affects qualities like availability, durability, and latency

Regions represent independent geographic areas and are composed of zones
A zone is an area where Google Cloud resources are deployed.

multi-region configurations allow you to replicate the database's data not just in multiple zones, but in multiple zones across multiple regions
